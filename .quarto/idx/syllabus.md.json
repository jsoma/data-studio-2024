We'll get you over that.\n\n### Other grading bits and pieces\n\nHonors will be given based on project creativity and execution. Pushing boundaries and learning new skills is rewarded.\n\nConsistently unsatisfactory work will result in a low pass. Unsatisfactory performance includes missing class, not turning in assignments, not participating in class, or other poor performance that results in written or academic warning.
