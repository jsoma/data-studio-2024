    "text": "Welcome to Data Studio! In this course we’re going to learn to be everyday visual journalists.\nWhether we’re building charts for our own stories or sitting on the graphics desk, this role encompasses everything from basic numeracy to design concepts. We’ll shore up our analysis and storytelling skills while at the same time becoming proficient in technical skills like HTML/CSS and Adobe Illustrator.\nThis is not a data visualization course! It’s a process class that accidentally ends up building a bunch of visuals, and a bunch of discussions that just happen to be about data visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points:\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s more important, data or graphics?\nWhat if you don’t want to be a designer?\nWhy don’t we just do interactives?\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting time: We’re officially scheduled for 9am-11:30am Mondays and Wednesdays, but we’ll most likely just do 10am-11:30am Mondays and Wednesdays. Some weeks we might throw all of the class time on one day.\nOffice hours: When are you free?\nTeaching assistant: Jasmine Cui, whose email address will appear in the future.\nOffice hours: Sunday evenings, and… see below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points:\n\n\n\n\nWhen do you have classes?\nThis will also affect due dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foundation of Data Studio is building projects.\nEvery two weeks you’ll be responsible for turning in a fully-fleshed-out project, featuring both words and graphics. In the first few weeks we’ll focus on the emotional and creative skills neccessary to brainstorm and execute a finished project, and then supplement that with technical, mathematical, and design abilites as we advance through the semester.\nTo guide you along the way, we’ll have both in-class critique sessions and out-of-class editorial meetings. The editorial meetings will be small group sessions with an actual data journalist who will provide guidance and feedback, while in-class sessions will focus on instructor feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points:\n\n\n\n\nWhat should the role of peer feedback be?\nWhen should we schedule mentorship meetings?\nHow should you come up with ideas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadings (and …listenings?) will run the gamut from how to not screw up a graphic, to techniques for making something pretty, to war stories from journalists about putting together a piece.\nThe more exposure you get to data visualization, the better your portfolio will look.\nThoughts on readings will be assessed by small quizzes and short-answer questions.\n\n\n\nBeing creative is tough, so I’m going to try to cram it into your head.\nMorning pages are tiny, tiny assignments due every day at 2PM for the first two weeks of the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points:\n\n\n\n\nAre you really making us do this dumb thing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe class attempts to be a balance of three approaches:\n\n\nCritique will involve an examination of student and professional work. Questions might include:\n\nWhat decisions were made in the production of a piece?\nWhat went well, and what could be improved?\nIs the work accessible and understandable?\nIs it well-designed?\n\nGenerally each week’s selection will revolve around a theme – e.g. color, annotation, data collection – and will provide the background for other sections of the class.\n\n\n\nLecture will typically be an extension of the critique section, where we focus on diving deeper into specific topics. Note that unlike last semester, practically all technical skills will be learned outside of class by reading texts, watching videos, or other self-teaching methods.\n\n\n\nThis is the reactive part of class, where topics that students have requested or need for their projects are covered. For example, we might cover how to use CSS flexbox if everyone is having trouble formatting the boxes on their homepage, or CSS margins to keep things aligned. Code review involves reviewing someone’s code and providing feedback.\nIf you have questions, ask them! They can change what’s covered.\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects and mentorship sessions: 50%\nCritiques and class participation: 25%\nHomework and readings: 25%\n\nThis class is very different from Foundations. The biggest change is you need to execute and fully complete every assignment, and hit every deadline for your projects. The first violation I’ll follow up with you, the second will be an official warning, an academic warning (which includes an improvement plan) and then academic probation.\nThis class is to some degree a “choose your own adventure,” where you can customize your learning path and set yourself up for a niche post-graduation. There are very few new technical skills that are required of you in this class – the goal of the course is to produce well-documented projects with a complete data diary and high-quality graphics. The tools aren’t (always) the important part.\nMuch of what we’re going to be learning this semester involves what I’ll sappily refer to as emotional growth: learning how to cope with imperfection, uncertainty, deadlines, giving and receiving critique, and making failure useful.\nFor example, people (generally) don’t miss deadlines because something is difficult, people misses deadlines because they don’t like what they’re turning in. We’ll get you over that.\n\n\nHonors will be given based on project creativity and execution. Pushing boundaries and learning new skills is rewarded.\nConsistently unsatisfactory work will result in a low pass. Unsatisfactory performance includes missing class, not turning in assignments, not participating in class, or other poor performance that results in written or academic warning. On the other hand, if you have something you need to miss class for or there’s some reason your performance is waning, just let me know and we can try to make accomodations.\n\n\n\n\nWeekly breakdown can be found here. It’s a rough sketch to give you a general idea of what we’re planning on doing."
